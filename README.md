End-to-end encrypted messaging with RSA-2048 and AES-CBC

</div>

## Core Tech Stack

- **Encryption**: RSA-2048 (key exchange) + AES-CBC (message encryption)
- **Storage**: Hive (encrypted local) + Firebase (cloud sync)
- **Auth**: QR-based key exchange + Anonymous IDs
- **Platform**: Flutter (Android/iOS)

## Key Features

- 🔐 End-to-end encryption with perfect forward secrecy
- 🔑 Secure key exchange via QR codes
- 💾 Encrypted local storage with cloud backup
- 👤 Anonymous user system with random nicknames
- 📱 Cross-platform with Material Design 3

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone & Setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/p42.git
cd p42
flutter pub get

# Run
flutter run
```

## Dependencies

```yaml
dependencies:
  pointycastle: ^3.9.1    # RSA/AES crypto
  encrypt: ^5.0.1         # AES implementation
  hive: ^2.2.3           # Encrypted storage
  firebase_core: ^2.4.0  # Backend
  cloud_firestore: ^4.3.0 # Database
  qr_flutter: ^4.0.0     # QR generation
  mobile_scanner: ^6.0.10 # QR scanning
```

## Security Implementation

- RSA-2048 for secure key exchange
- AES-CBC with unique session keys
- Fortuna secure random generation
- Encrypted local storage (Hive)
- Private keys never leave device
- Secure cloud sync (Firebase)

## Development

```bash
# Setup
flutter doctor
flutter pub get

# Code Generation
flutter pub run build_runner build

# Test
flutter test
```
